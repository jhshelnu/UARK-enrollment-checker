# UARK Enrollment Checker

**Simple script to check the UARK registrars course listings for an availability in Mobile Programming and text me if a spot has opened up**

Usage (local):

	- install pytz and twilio packages via pip
	- Create a file named 'secrets.py'
	- Copy the contents of 'secrets_example.py' into 'secrets.py', filling out your info as needed
	- Run the python script

Usage (Docker):

	- Build and run the image (already contains python and required packages!)
